- 👋 Hi, I’m @makayla-pinto
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (duh!), video games, and website development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, Python, C++, and JavaScript (I am, however, trying to learn as many lanugages as I can while I study for my A.A.S. in Computer Programming)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm open to a variety of pretty much anything I can get my hands on!
- 📫 How to reach me: my email! -> makayla.pinto20@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've worked at my current job for a collective 5+ years! When I love a place of business I tend to keep with it for as long as I can!
